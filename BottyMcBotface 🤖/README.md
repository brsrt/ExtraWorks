# Welcome to 🎉 **BottyMcBotface** 🤖

Ahoy, fellow bot enthusiasts! Welcome to the zaniest, most ridiculous Discord bot project this side of the internet! If you’re looking to learn, laugh, and maybe cry a little (from all the fun, of course!), then you’ve found the right place.

## What in the World is This? 🌎

This is **BottyMcBotface**, your soon-to-be favorite Discord bot that does all the cool things you didn’t know you needed! Think of it as your new digital sidekick, with more wit than a dad joke convention and as reliable as that one friend who always brings snacks.

## What's Inside? 🎁

- **🗂 commands/**: The brain of the operation. Every command your bot will ever need lives here, ready to jump into action at your whim. Need a dance-off? A quick joke? Maybe some random wisdom? It's all here!
  
- **🎉 events/**: Where the magic happens! This is the bot’s reaction chamber. Whether someone joins, leaves, sneezes, or just lurks – if it happens, it’s an event, and this is where we handle it.
  
- **🔧 config.js**: The secret sauce. This file is where all the important stuff like tokens and other mystical data is stored. **Note:** Passwords are like the cookie jar – keep ‘em safe! 🍪 (We'll be adding `.env` support soon, so the secrets can stay secret!)

## Setting It Up 🛠️

1. **Navigate to the Folder**:  
   This bot lives in the `ExtraWorks` folder of your main repository. Simply navigate there:

   ```sh
   cd ExtraWorks/BottyMcBotface
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Your Bot**:  
   Head over to `config.js` and plug in your token and other goodies. Make sure to keep them hush-hush 🤫.

4. **Run the Bot**:  

   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

   And just like that, you’ve unleashed chaos fun on your Discord server!

## Future Plans 🗓️

- Adding `.env` support, because keeping secrets in `config.js` is like storing treasure in your backyard – it’s just a matter of time before the pirates find it! 🏴‍☠️
- More commands, more events, more botty goodness. Suggestions welcome! ✉️

## Contributing 🤝

Got a cool idea? A funny joke? An extra slice of pizza? We accept pull requests and pizza donations alike. Let’s make BottyMcBotface the best bot it can be, one line of code and one emoji at a time! 🍕🤖

## License 📜

Happy coding, and may the bot be with you! 🎮✨
